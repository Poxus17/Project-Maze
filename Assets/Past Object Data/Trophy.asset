  transcript: 'I remeber the day Georgie got this trophy.


    They won the Cruz
    county tournement, Georgie was hitting home runs like he was Barry bonds. Later
    on we all went to the Blue Whale restaurant. It was our favorite. That''s probably
    the happiest I ever saw Georgie.


    I miss him.'
