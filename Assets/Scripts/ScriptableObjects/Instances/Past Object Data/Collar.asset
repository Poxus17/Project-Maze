  transcript: "This collar belonged to church. He was the sweetest, most loyal dog.
    Georgie and I loved him like he was our third brother. They say dogs are man's
    best friend... I can't argue with that. \nI remember the summer Church died.
    We were so depressed that mom and dad tried everything to cheer us up. That was
    the same summer dad built our treehouse."
