  transcript: I remember when dad bought Georgie his first bike, Georgie was so hyped
    to ride them he couldn't stop smiling the entire ride home. Turns out He was
    a naturel, In only a few days he was riding around our neighborhood showing off
    the neighbors... Man... Everything was so simple back then.
