  transcript: Lurkstone wasn't exactly known for sunshine and smiles. Town residents
    were always cold and distant. They didn't seem to care for anyone but themselves.
    Not Georgie though. anytime he used to ride his bike, his smile could melt even
    the coldest of hearts. I guess why, when he went missing, most town residents
    joined the effort to find him. Of course it only lasted for a short while. In
    about two weeks, Georgie's disappearance became yesterday's news, and his bike
    was left lonely, while the people of Lurkstone continued their lives.
