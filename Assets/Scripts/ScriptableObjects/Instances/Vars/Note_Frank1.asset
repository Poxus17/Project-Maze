    text: "The frigid air surrounding me brings back memories of the nights spent
      traversing the scorching Sahara desert. Back then, they would say, \"The morning
      always comes,\" offering a glimmer of hope. However, in this desolate place,
      that hope seems elusive.   \n\nYet, I mustn't succumb to despair. I must press
      on, relentless in my search for answers. Every step taken in this maze brings
      me closer to unraveling its enigmatic secrets. The chilling cold may test my
      resolve, but I refuse to be defeated.   \n\nFrank."
