    text: "During my desert expedition, plagued by hunger and thirst, I chanced upon
      an enigmatic figure\u2014an old man seemingly conjured by the harsh sands.
      He kindly offered me refuge, food, and water. As the desert nights grew cold,
      we huddled around a comforting campfire, and it was then that he unraveled
      a haunting tale of a joyless bustling void in the folds of our reality. while
      I had a hard time understanding his words, somehow they made sense. \n\nLooking
      back at\_ those nights spent in his desert shack leaves me questioning the
      authenticity of his existence. Now, as I find myself trapped in this maze,
      a lingering uncertainty engulfs me\u2014was he truly real, or a mere mirage
      born from the illusions of the desert? \n\nFrank."
