    text: "In this puzzling maze, even within the only place of comfort it offers
      - an exact copy of my childhood room - my tired eyes find no rest. It beckons
      me to close them and take a break, but I must resist. How can there be safety
      in this strange place? Though it might seem like the best spot to stay, I can't
      linger here forever. I must find a way to escape from this labyrinth, no matter
      what! \n\nFrank"
